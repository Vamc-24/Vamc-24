## Hey there!

I'm  [Vamsi](/https://linktr.ee/bommusaivamsi/), a Data Science enthusiast.

I train, build and deploy Machine learning models as your requirement.

I always aim to prevent overfitting ~ generalized model, to get good accuracy.

My main tech stack is Python, SQL, PowerBI, SKlearn etc

I've got a bunch of pinned projects,but my favorite is the [Startup profit prediction](/https://github.com/Vamc-24/Startup_profit-Linear-Regression/)
